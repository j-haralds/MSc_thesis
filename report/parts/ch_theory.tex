    \caption{Schematic view of a neural network where each circle represents a single neuron. An input signal $\bm{X} = \{\bm{x}_i\}_{i=0}^{N}$ enters the model in the input layer, proceeds through the hidden layers, and exits from the output layer. This process produces an output $\bm{Y} = \{\bm{y}_i\}_{i=0}^{M}$, which can be interpreted as a prediction based on the input data.}
