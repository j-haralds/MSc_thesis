\section{Overview of Batteries}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A battery's parts, anode, cathode, electrolyte. Cell vs. module. 
    \item The general working principle: charging and discharging. Potential negative effects that need to be considered. Heat developement, or other factors affecting performance of the cell. 
    \item What equations are governing? (Thermodynamics, Mechanics, electric, chemical) 
\end{itemize}

\section{Neural Networks} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item General overview of neural networks. Explain neurons, weights, bias, loss function, different types of NNs. RNN?? 

    \item How to make NNs PINNs? 
    \item 
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Schematic view of a neural network where each circle represents a single neuron. An input signal $\bm{X} = \{\bm{x}_i\}_{i=0}^{N}$ enters the model in the input layer, proceeds through the hidden layers, and exits from the output layer. This process produces an output $\bm{Y} = \{\bm{y}_i\}_{i=0}^{M}$, which can be interpreted as a prediction based on the input data.}
