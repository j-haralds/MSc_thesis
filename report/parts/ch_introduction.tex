\section{Background}
With an ever growing demand for convenient energy storage, the use of \glspl{lib} in portable devices have skyrocketed over the last 30 years.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Why batteries? (Nobel prize 2019, a game changer in our modern lives, necessary for climate change)
    \item However, there are still problems, and the hunt for even more energy efficient batteries requires models to describe the physical properties of batteries. 
    \item While models based on \gls{fe} can be used to simulate such systems to a high accuracy, they are often computationally costly \cite{Asheri}. Instead, .
